# Gravity Simulation

This project is a simple gravity simulation implemented in JavaScript using an HTML5 canvas. It demonstrates the basic principles of particle motion under the influence of gravity.

## Getting Started

To run the gravity simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Run `python3 -m http.server`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:8000`
3. You should see a canvas displaying particles affected by gravity.
